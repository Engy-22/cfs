=head1 CFS perllib

=head2 Modules

=head3 CFS::DB

Defines local database connection parameters.  Currently on localhost without
strong credentials, as development has occurred on a local CentOS 6 VM.

=head4 CFS::DB::Object::AutoBase1

Base module from which that classes generated by genDBclasses.pl inherit.

=head3 CFS::GoogleAPI

Class used to make calls to Google Prediction API.  Reference implementation
can be found in google_prediction.pl.

=head3 CFS::*

The remainder of the modules are Rose::DB-inherited classes auto-generated by
genDBclasses.pl for database interaction.

=head2 Scripts

=head3 export_training_data.pl

Exports CSV training data used to train the models.  See README in
../training_data for more information on the output format.

=head3 genDBclasses.pl

Generates new DB classes - run after schema changes.

=head3 google_prediction.pl

Simple Google Prediction API client.

Usage:

C<< ./google_prediction.pl list >>

C<< ./google_prediction.pl get <model_id> >>

C<< ./google_prediction.pl analyze <model_id> >>

C<< ./google_prediction.pl predict <model_id> 'field1,field2,field3,..' >>

C<< ./google_prediction.pl insert <model_id> <storage-bucket/training_data.csv> >>

C<< ./google_prediction.pl delete <model_id> >>

=head3 parse_past_schedules.pl

Imports schedule data in ../source_data into past_games table (which is
ultimately used as training data).

Usage:

C<< ./parse_past_schedules.pl path/to/schedule.csv [path/to/schedule2.csv ...] >>

=head3 parse_repole_lines.pl

Imports spreads/lines downloaded from http://www.repole.com/sun4cast/data.html
and updates past_games table.

Usage:

C<< ./parse_repole_lines.pl path/to/lines.csv >>

=head3 parse_schedule.pl

Imports schedule data in ../source_data into games table (which is used for
current-year predictions).

Usage:

C<< ./parse_schedule.pl path/to/schedule.csv [<start_week>] [<end_week>] >>

Can be used to import games one week at a time - useful for mid-season updates.

=head3 parse_schools.pl

Imports list of teams/schools that was downloaded from sports-reference.com.

Usage:

C<< ./parse_schools.pl < path/to/schools.html > path/to/schools.csv >>

=head3 parse_stats.pl

Parses and imports stats data downloaded from sports-reference.com

Usage:

C<< ./parse_stats.pl path/to/season/ [path/to/season2 path/to/season3 ...] >>

=head3 populate_psuedo_games.pl

Inserts records into sim_games table to simulate a double round-robin schedule
all teams.  The predicted results of the simulated 'psuedo-games' are the basis
of team rankings.

Usage:

C<< ./populate_psuedo_games.pl >>

TODO: Added season, week, and model-id as command-line options.

=head3 print_rankings.pl

Print rankings based on sim_games results.

Usage:

C<< ./print_rankings.pl <season> <week> >>

=head3 process_prediction_queue.pl

Process any un-predicted games in games table (if 'predict' is passed) or
sim_games table (if 'sim' is passed).

Usage:

C<< ./process_prediction_queue.pl [predict|sim] >>
